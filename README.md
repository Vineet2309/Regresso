Team Name-Regresso
FinNav is a smart web platform developed by Team Regresso to help Indian MSMEs understand how changes in GST, corporate tax, and budget policies impact their businesses.
Users log in and enter key business details like business name, sector etc.. .  Our model then fetches data, analyzes it, and:
 Predicts an Impact Score (from –1 to +1)
 Gives smart investment suggestions
 Shows clear bar and pie charts explaining the prediction
The ML model is built using Linear Regression 
 This is our first project as first-year students. Since we're still learning, we couldn't deploy it online — but the entire system works perfectly on localhost, and the full code is provided for testing.
